This is a Senior Thesis developed to get the BSc Aerospace Engineering at the University of Leon. However, this project was done at the University of Vermont during an exchange program. The main purpose of this thesis was to couple an heuristic optimization method, such as genetic algorithm (GA) with aerospace systems, simulated with computer fluid dynamic (CFD) that are to be optimized in multiple objectives.

The project required some software to be present in the computer in order to properly run it. The requisites are ``python3`` (with either ``jupyter notebook`` or ``jupyter lab`` to execute the notebooks and understand the basics of the process), ``OpenFOAM`` (version 5.00 was used) and ``paraView`` (version 5.4.0). Required Python packages are the basic ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``, ``scipy``, ``numba``, ``sympy``... However ``optunity``, ``prettytable``, ``tdqm`` and ``prettytable`` are required to run every notebook.  The operating system used for Python bash commands and scripting was ``Ubuntu 16.04 LTS``. Compatibility with other OS have not been tested.
